Unique Group Name: Synergy.

Project Topic Name/Title: Kwik Doctor.

Description: Kwik Doctor lies in providing patients with easy access to healthcare practitioners so that they can establish early contact and be adequately diagnosed from wherever they are in the country. This would act like a "911 system and more serious cases can be troubleshot and redirected as necessary".

This initiative is geared towards empowering doctors with Telemedicine skills and providing avenues where they can channel these skills into solving real-life problems in their field thereby setting them up for lifelong success.
On the patient side of it, it would improve access to quality healthcare.
Some of the strategies we would be engaging in include;

- Web development
- User- Friendly interface
- Soft skills training
- Webinars, Health fairs, Enlightening Rural dwellers etc.
- Collaboration with Government/international funding organization

SDG Goal: Good health and wellbeing â€“ To promote health, safety and healthy living amongst people of all ages.

Why it was chosen: Most people have little or no idea how telemedicine can improve their health and lives in general, yet good health and wellbeing are paramount to every other aspect of life including education, nutrition or diet, finances, state of mind and it impacts critical life choices.

There is a need to seek effective ways of advocating for telemedicine in our society if we are to measure up to world standards in terms of innovations in the health care systems. This will thereby minimize delayed treatment and reduce the mortality rate caused by delayed diagnosis.

SYNERGY intends to solve the problem of delayed access to healthcare by introducing an online software interface approach, which "Links patients to quality healthcare".
